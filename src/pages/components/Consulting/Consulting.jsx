        <h3>Tech-Driven, People-Focused🅿️</h3>
        <p>
          Although I have less than <strong>4 months of professional experience</strong>,
          I’ve already developed strong skills in <strong>Project Management</strong> and <strong>Technology Consulting</strong>. 
          I understand how to plan, coordinate, and deliver tech projects effectively while 
          aligning with real business goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve provided guidance on the right tools, stacks, and architecture choices 
          for startups and teams — ensuring scalability, cost-effectiveness, and future-proofing. 
          My focus is not only on writing code, but on solving the right problems.
        </p>
